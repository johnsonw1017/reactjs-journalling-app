# Journalling app

## Brain dump
- Homepage (/): Welcome message at the top, contains current date as title, header has edit and delete icon and footer has the final edit date & time and a save button, the journal content is below title. Shows the current day entry if there is any.
- Calendar page (/calendar): contains a calendar of the current month with streak counter
- Journal page (/journal/:journalID): individual journal page, similar to the homepage but does not have the welcome message

(optional)
- Search page (/search): searches for keywords in the journal content and return results based on the frequency of the keyword appearance - may need to exclude words like "the, and, a" etc.
- photo upload feature in homepage and journal page
